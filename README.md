## Theme Philosophy
Pavão Discreto is crafted with a focus on creating a comfortable coding experience, particularly for users with visual impairments. Both our Dark and Light themes avoid pure white backgrounds and employ carefully selected color schemes to significantly reduce eye strain. The color schemes have been thoughtfully curated to ensure optimal contrast and readability in any lighting condition.

We encourage users with monitors that support eye-safe functionality to enable it for an enhanced experience. Each file type features distinct color combinations for easy visual identification. We dedicated considerable effort to ensure that every extension was meticulously designed, allowing you to quickly discern the type of file you are working with at a glance.

As a personal user of this theme, I have dedicated significant time and effort to its development to alleviate my own eye strain. I invite you to compare your comfort level before and after using Pavão Discreto. Furthermore, I continuously seek to adapt the theme for improved functionality.

Please note that some macOS users have reported color adaptation issues; I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and I appreciate your understanding. Your enjoyment and feedback are invaluable—don't forget to leave a positive review!
